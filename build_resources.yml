# YAML Configuration File for Qt Resource Building
#
# This YAML file defines the configuration for building Qt UI and resource files using the tk-build-qt-resources script.
# Each entry in the file represents a separate build configuration with the following fields:
#
# - ui_src: The source directory containing the Qt .ui files.
# - ui_files: A list of .ui file names (without extensions) to compile.
# - new_names_ui_files: (Optional) A list of new names for the compiled .ui files (without extensions).
#                       If not provided, the original names will be used.
# - res_files: A list of .qrc resource file names (without extensions) to compile.
# - py_dest: The destination directory where the compiled .py files will be placed.
# - import_pattern: The import text pattern to replace (default is "tank.platform.qt").
#
# Example:
#
# - ui_src: "path/to/ui_files"
#   ui_files:
#     - main_window
#   res_files:
#     - resources
#   py_dest: "path/to/output"
#   import_pattern: "custom.import.path"
